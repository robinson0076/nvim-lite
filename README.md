# nvim-lite

Neovim config, designed for a lazy kid that prioritize spending time watching Youtube other than learning Lua to make better config file.

Neovim config, designed for a kid who doesn't need fancy things on their Neovim (like adults usually put on their Neovim)

Who is him?
"Sou watashi desu!" (Yes, it's me)

### Requirements

- Neovim (of course you need this for some plugins, you can't use Vim with Lua plugins)
- Nerd Fonts (otherwise the statusbar will just show some shape instead of icons)

### How to install this thing

Easy, just copy `nvim` folder inside `.config` folder into your config directory (Usually, it will be in `~/.config/`. Copy it there)

After that, you need to copy `nvim` directory again, but now copy the one inside `.local/share` directory. Copy it at `~/.local/share/`.

Then, open your Neovim. You will be greeted with bunch of errors, I think (If yes, then you are just like me). Just ignore that for this time and hit `Enter`

When in `Normal` mode, run `:PlugInstall` and wait until it's finished. Re-launch Neovim, the errors will gone, and a new look will appear.
(If not, solve it yourself, ehe.)

And it's over, just it.
(Well, sorry for not-so-straightforward guide. I am a "shota", you know...)

### What kind of plugins this config installs?
`nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter`
`windwp/nvim-autopairs`
`windwp/nvim-ts-autotag`
`nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim`

## Kind of warning, I guess?

1. This config is optimized for phone (because I use phone to code)
2. This is maybe too minimal for you (but it's enough for me). But if you want to add something, it's easier than some adult configs that uses complicated file structure.


That's it, have a nice day, sir.
